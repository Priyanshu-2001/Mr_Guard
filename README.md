Andorid App Designed for Hackathon Organized by Infosys and Chandigarh Police on 15 Nov 2021

Basically Here we tried to make each police officer an individual entity like it is with driver in Uber so whenever some one raises an alarm the nearby police is send summon alert with victim's live location .

there is also a chat section which appears when victim is connected to Police personal so that he or she can explain the situation to Poilce noiseless

we also added stats section so that senior police official can overlook every employe under them and make the process much clean. Same section is Provided to Victim user also so that he can see the details of contacted police and after the job is finished he can provide a feedBack and that feedback can be viewed by senior officials for maintaining the progress


future scopes:
Though scope is endless but we thought of adding more deep analytics which can be later used to see the crime rates of different regions which would help police to enforce the law with more precisely according to situation of particular sector.
